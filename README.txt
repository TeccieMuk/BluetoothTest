** HOW TO USE **
This site can be run on a local bluetooth-enabled laptop using a host such as the Webserver for Chrome app,
or it can be hosted online. HTTPS must be enabled. An easy way to accomplish this is to upload this to a 
Github repository (or Bitbucket Cloud). You can use the Github Pages function to host it online. It can then
be reached by an android browser.
